### Paper Analysis
1. [Water detection with segmentation guided dynamic texture recognition](../../paper/bankline-detection/machine-learning/robio_2012.pdf)
    > It offers a machine learning method K - means to detect the bankline.

2. [Automatic Detection, Classification and Tracking of Objects in the Ocean Surface from UAVs Using a Thermal Camera](../../paper/bankline-detection/machine-learning/07119238.pdf)
    >It provides background subtraction, edge detection and mean shift segmentation for detection with machine learning to produce the infrared image including reducing the noice of infrared image with Gauss filter

### Code refactoring 
- [demo](../../code/code.py)
  - [code report](../../code/report-for-code/demo.md)

### Self Learning 
None 

### What need to do
- Try to implement the code and make it by yourself!

### Goal
- Try to find a method which can combine the two kind of photos to detect the bankline
- Try to find an image segmentation method to cut the RGB image and make it the same area as the thermal camera images
