### Paper Analysis
1. [Detectability of Objects at the Sea Surface in Visible Light and Thermal Camera Images](./paper/bankline-detection/traditional-method/OCEANS18_dahlin.pdf)
    > The method idea in this paper is similar to our traditional idea.

### Self Learning 
1. [week1](../self-learning/scyzd1_opencv_learning.md)

### Goal
- Try to find a method which can combine the two kind of photos to detect the bankline
- Try to find an image segmentation method to cut the RGB image and make it the same area as the thermal camera images
